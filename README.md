# Manus Haptic Glove Project - Unity 3D

## Overview

This repository contains selected code files from my final year project at University. The project involved designing and implementing a user interface (UI) that integrates with Manus haptic gloves. The primary objective was to create an interactive "game" for participant testing, enabling the collection of data for research purposes.

## Project Description

The project was centered around creating a Unity 3D application and the gloves to study user's perception of touch through the analysis of the JND. Here are the key components and details of the project:

- **Game for Participant Testing**: The UI was part of a game designed specifically for participant testing. The game facilitated various interactions that allowed me to collect data on how users interacted with the haptic feedback provided by the gloves.

- **Algorithm Development**: I developed the algorithm used for data collection from the participant interactions. This algorithm was crucial for capturing meaningful data to analyze the effectiveness and user experience of the haptic gloves.

### Code Files

- **Custom Code**: The repository includes the code I wrote for the UI and data collection algorithm (ChooseScripts.cs).

- **Unity Plugin Code**: The Hand and Finger files contain code from the Manus Unity plugin. While I did not write this code, I had to thoroughly understand it and make minor adjustments to ensure it integrated properly with my custom code.



## Appendix: Project Images

Here are some images from the project along with brief descriptions:

### Data Visualization on MATLAB

The data extrapolated from the experiment was visualized using MATLAB. The image below demonstrates a visualization of how the ChooseScript.cs algorithm works.

### Results Analysis

The overall results showed significant changes in the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) of participants at different baseline intensities.

### Lab Setup and Behind the Scenes

This image shows the behind-the-scenes setup where the magic all happened. Various glove capabilities such as hand tracking and full-body tracking were tested during the project. However, I ran out of time to explore these further and integrate them into the project.
