# Project Images

Below are some images from the project along with brief descriptions:

## Data Visualization on MATLAB

The data extrapolated from the experiment was visualized using MATLAB. The image below demonstrates a visualization of how the ChooseScript.cs algorithm works.

## Lab Setup and Behind the Scenes

This image shows the behind-the-scenes setup where the magic all happened. Various glove capabilities such as hand tracking and full-body tracking were tested during the project. However, I ran out of time to explore these further and integrate them into the project.
